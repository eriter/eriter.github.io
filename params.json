My name's Eli, and I'm a startup guy.\r\n\r\nI don't mean that I've worked at startups--though I have, in a variety of capacities over the last three years--but that I'm constitutionally incapable of being satisfied with 'good enough' in my professional life. I don't have an academic background in computer science, but I've built my own web apps, and worked with both new code and legacy apps serving millions of monthly users. \r\n\r\nI like staying up all night to call the right people in China, I like making my own stocks, I like tracking down weird bugs with UTF-8 character encoding or oauth. I like Vim golf and sustainable pace and things that, no matter how much they are overpraised, really **are** that good.\r\n\r\nB","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
